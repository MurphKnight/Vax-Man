### Vax-Man/Edited-Pacman in Python with PyGame


This is the code that I submitted to Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program:  Task 1

Task 1: Python

The instruction:
	Building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:

	- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
	- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
	- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
	- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.


The pacman code was from https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman.
